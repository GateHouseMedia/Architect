# Architect

The easy-to-use, easy-to-customize longform project template from GateHouse Media. Architect gives newsrooms a space for designing and creating special projects that pulls analytics and ads just like their regular sites. The editor is created with PageBuilder widgets that allow you to drag and drop elements to create beautiful stories.

But that's all available to learn about at [despace.design/architect](https://despace.design/architect).

This repo is for people who really want to customize Architect to create amazing projects in their newsroom.
