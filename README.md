# Architect

The easy-to-use, easy-to-customize longform project template from GateHouse Media. Architect gives newsrooms a space for designing and creating special projects that pulls analytics and ads just like their regular sites. The editor is created with PageBuilder widgets that allow you to drag and drop elements to create beautiful stories.

But that's all available to learn about at [despace.design/architect](https://despace.design/architect).

This repo is for people who really want to customize Architect to create amazing projects in their newsroom.

## Getting Started

Our WordPress instances are hosted using WPEngine. You can use this theme by downloading it, making your customizations and uploading it into the WordPress editor. For access to SFTP, contact the innovation team.

You may also want to check out MAAMP or a similar solution to mess around locally.

### About the files

The important Architect magic is mainly contained to header.php and /inc/child_widgets.php
These two files are heavily commented to explain what each function does. The key is pulling the Google Analytics and DFP tags out of newspaper.com and turning them into WordPress variables.
